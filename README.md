Landing Page Having a Responsive Navbar 

Hi! Basically I wanted to make a cricket store. It has many feature such as a sticky navbar which does'nt change its position when scrolled
I used HTML to structure it all and CSS for designing, Javascript is also used in this to add functionalities like change of covers and moving to the respective section

Overall its a great project just started learning Web Development
A great Initiative.
